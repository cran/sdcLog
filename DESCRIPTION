Description: Tools for researchers to explicitly show that their
    results comply to rules for statistical disclosure control imposed by
    research data centers. These tools help in checking descriptive
    statistics and models and in calculating extreme values that are not
    individual data. Also included is a simple function to create log
    files. The methods used here are described in the "Guidelines for the
    checking of output based on microdata research" by Bond, Brandt, and
    de Wolf (2015)
