1.  **I want to use `sdc_log()` on a `main.R` script which calls several other
    scripts via `source()` in the order I need in my analysis. But the contents
    from the other R scripts are not logged. How can I log the outputs from the
    subordinated scripts as well?**
    
    In your `main.R` script, use `sdc_log()` instead of `source()` to run the
    subordinated scripts. This way, you will end up with a separate log file for
    each script which is called via `sdc_log()` from `main.R`.

This vignette will be extended as users have more questions.

```{r reset options, include=FALSE}
options(user_options)
```
