\usage{
sdc_log(r_script, destination, replace = FALSE, append = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{r_script}{\link{character} Path of the R script to be run with logging.}

\item{destination}{One of:
\itemize{
\item \link{character} Path of the log file to be used.
\item \link{file} connection to which the log should be written. This is especially
useful, when you have nested calls to \code{sdc_log()} and want to write
everything into the same log file. Then, create a single \link{file} connection
and provide this connection to all calls to \code{sdc_log()} (and close it
afterwards).
}}

\item{replace}{\link{logical} Indicates whether to replace an existing log file.}

\item{append}{\link{logical} Indicates whether to append an existing log file.}
}
\value{
\link{character} vector holding the path(s) of the written log file(s).
}
\description{
This function creates Stata-like log files from R Scripts. It
